# To Do

## 1. Small things that could be directly added
* Custom colors
* 3D-ize by adding depth (radius size and overlap)

## 2. Things that require some rethinking/reorganizing
* Add Controller class
* * Loads multiple Attractors from a single file
* * Create standards for scope and rotation

## 3. Cool functionality to add at some point
* Make it so that a single Lorenz system "spawns" new ones with slightly shifted position

## 4. Future ideas
* Apply some kind of real time facial/image recognition to the drawing at every frame
